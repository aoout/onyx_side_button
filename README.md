# Onyx Side Button

This plugin enables the use of [Onyx Book](https://zh.boox.com/)'s side buttons to control page flipping in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Usage

To use this plugin, follow these steps:

1. On your Onyx reader, go to the settings and configure the side key function to control page turning for Obsidian.
2. Install this plugin.
3. Once installed, the plugin will automatically enable the use of the Onyx side buttons to flip pages in Obsidian. Additionally, you can adjust the flipping bias in the plugin settings to fine-tune the page turning experience.

With these simple steps, you can enjoy a more intuitive and convenient reading experience with Obsidian on your Onyx reader.


## üåü Other Plugins

I also recommend using my other Obsidian plugins, [epub importer](https://github.com/aoout/obsidian-epub-importer) and [highlighter](https://github.com/aoout/obsidian-highlighter). These plugins can greatly enhance your reading and note-taking experience in Obsidian, especially when used in conjunction with Onyx Book.
