## 🤖 Developing

To make changes to this plugin, first ensure you have the dependencies installed.

```
npm install
```

To start building the plugin with what mode enabled run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

> **Note**
> If you haven't already installed the hot-reload-plugin you'll be prompted to. You need to enable that plugin in your obsidian vault before hot-reloading will start. You might need to refresh your plugin list for it to show up.
> To start a release build run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

> **Note**
> You can use the `.env` file with adding the key `VAULT_DEV` to specify the path to your Obsidian (development) vault. This will allow you to test your plugin without specify each times the path to the vault.
